# Skill library

One tree, `.claude/skills/`, 236 skills. Names are `<group>_<subgroup>_<leaf>`:
underscores are the hierarchy, hyphens are word breaks inside a segment. Claude
Code discovers skills at exactly one directory level, so the underscore is the
only tree there is — nesting a skill deeper makes it invisible.

51 of them carry a description in the session roster and can auto-invoke. The
185 below are set to `user-invocable-only`: installed and current, but costing
nothing until needed. They are not second-class — the roster is chosen by what
this stack triggers, not by quality.

To use one, invoke it as `/<name>` or read its `SKILL.md` and follow it exactly
as if it had loaded itself. If you reach for the same skill repeatedly, add its
name to `.claude/skills.manifest` and run
`bash plugins/id-workflow/hooks/sync-skills.sh` to promote it.
